# AnyLogic-JSONifier

A simple library for enabling JSON serialization and deserialization for various AnyLogic types, usable both as an add-on library inside AnyLogic (i.e., as an object you drag into your model) or inside any external editor (i.e., programmaticly created).

The serialization features (converting any object to JSON) come with a deeply customizable filter to specify what exactly gets outputted. It can be setup in a "blacklist" or "whitelist" mode with different ways of targeting specific parts of your model.

The deserialization features (converting from JSON to an object) not only include conversion to any standard Java types, but also to AnyLogic objects, including agents and populations! This opens up the ability to have customized ways to initialize your model.
